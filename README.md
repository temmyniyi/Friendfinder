# Friendfinder
The friend finder app is a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically like a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from user surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

Express is used to handle routing;, and the app is also deployed to heroku.
